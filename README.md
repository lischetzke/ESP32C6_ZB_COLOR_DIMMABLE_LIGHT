Folder `Zigbee_Light_Bulb` contains modified Arduino IDE example for ESP32C6.

Folder `Zigbee2MQTT` contains configuration files for using ZB2MQTT.

Just try it and build something own. It's meant to help others initially. Took some time to research, code, test this, but I'm glad this is working and hope that more projects with ESP32-C6 and Zigbee/Thread are coming.
